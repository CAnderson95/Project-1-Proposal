QUESTIONS:

How have current circumstances affected the housing market in terms of buying vs. selling compared to years past.
  Are there areas that are more heavily affected than others? 
    Are these areas simply geographically affected, or is it more spatial (as in proximity to a major population center)

What trends are we seeing from homebuyers/sellers, are we seeing an ingress towards or away from cities/ heavily populated states
  If there is a trend, what does this say about our real-estate climate as a whole
    Can we make any predictions about the future of the housing market based on our findings?
